  "summary": "The diff adds guarded React Query profile loading tied to actor/identity readiness and updates CRMApp to show explicit loading and recoverable error UI (with Retry) instead of a blank/infinite loading state on refresh. It also updates the failure copy to clear professional English.",

    {
      "description": "Clearing the entire React Query cache on retry (queryClient.clear()) rather than only refetching the failed dashboard/profile query.",
      "reason": "REQ-1 requires a recoverable error state with retry, but does not request clearing all cached queries; this is an additional behavior that could affect other app state.",
